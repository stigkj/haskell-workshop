    Try running this by setting this module as the current target
    and hitting Ctrl+Enter

        * `putStrLn` is a function that prints a given string to the console

   return your name:

myName = "Stig"

  ... then change the target to `Tests` and hit Run again.
  You passed a test, right? Congrats.
